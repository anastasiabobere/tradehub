# TRADEHUB

## What is it?

This website is made for a school project by me, Anastasia Bobere.
The idea behind it to help reduce fast fashion tendences in our society and promote exchanging items culture in our communities.

## Progress

The website is finished and there is no planned updates. 

## What is different from regular thrift shops?

Here you can not only sell your items but it is encouraged to exchange them for something that you need. For example, if you lost weight and the clothes dont fit you anymore you can exchange them with a person who is in an opposite situation and needs bigger clothes! This way we are not letting anything go to waste and creating this endless cycle of reusing our items. Because even if the item is not "usable" anymore, someone can always find a use of it.
